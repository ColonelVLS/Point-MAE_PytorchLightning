This is a reimplementation of Point-MAE (https://github.com/Pang-Yatian/Point-MAE).

The main task of this repo is to seperate the crucial parts of the code making it more understandable. 
We also use PytorchLightning to make this even more reproducable and easy to understand. 

## Installation 

Clone this repo. Do not forget to add --recursive at the end of the clone command to also clone
the proper version of *dl_lib*.

You also have to download and build the extension folder from the original Point-MAE repo.
